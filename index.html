# Chapter 59 - Cicero's use of language
Arrow keys or scroll to navigate.

---

# Personal Pronouns
Cicero uses _ego_ to emphasize his role in protecting himself, in contrast with Catiline (_tū_) who has sent the men to attack him. This creates an increased separation between the two and serves the purpose of framing Cicero's argument as good vs evil.
> "quōs ego iam multīs ac summīs virīs ad mē

      (B)
---

# Parallelism
Cicero uses a parallel structure and a bit of repetition to emphasize his issues with Catiline's actions. By having this bit situated at the end of his rant Cicero drives home his point and creates a sense of finality in how he won't be dissuaded from attacking Catiline.
> "nōn feram, nōn patiar, nōn sinam.

      (B)
---

# Diction
Cicero specifically refers to the gods as _immortālibus_/immortal, and begins the sentence directly by giving thanks. By thanking the gods, Cicero establishes himself as a good Roman who follows tradition, in contrast to Catiline who seeks to create a bit of a revolution.
> "Magna dīs immortālibus habenda est atque huic ipsī Iovī Statōrī

      (C)    
---

# Reppetition
Cicero repeats his urging for Catiline to leave the city, first mentioning it, then explaining why he believes Catiline should leave, and then once more urging him to leave. By repeating his request like this Cicero reminds the audience as to the point of his speech, and it works as a bit of a call-to-action.
> "quod tē iam dūdum hortor ... nōn iubeō, sed, sī mē cōnsulis, suādeō

      (D)

# Rhetorical Devices
Cicero uses a rhetorical question to make his audience think about the crimes of Catiline. This question makes it apparent that Cicero sees it as fitting for Catiline to be killed, and is rather surprised by the continued inaction of the senate.
> "Senātus haec intellegit, cōnsul videt; hic tamen vīvit. Vīvit?

      (A)
---

# Rhetorical Devices
Cicero speaks directly to Catiline at the beginning of this passage, making the speech much more adversarial. Presumably, Catiline was present at the speech however because Cicero was the one speaking he'd be able to directly attack Catiline without Catiline being able to defend himself.
> "Nunc iam apertē rem pūblicam ūniversam petis

      (D)
---
      
# Parallelism
Cicero uses a parallel structure in this phrase to add a bit of flow to his speech. He claims that both the senate and the consul should be aware of Catiline's crimes and side with Cicero, and by phrasing it as a list it may add a bit of a feeling that there are many factors, despite only mentioning those two entities.
> "Senātus haec intellegit, cōnsul videt; hic tamen vīvit

      (A)
---
      
# Diction
Cicero refers to Catiline's associates as dangerous dregs which will _exhauriētur_/be drained out of the city. This use of the verb dehumanizes Catiline's coconspirators to some extent and diminishes them as something that would drain out rather than leave like normal Romans.
> "exhauriētur ex urbe tuōrum comitum magna et perniciōsa sentīna reī pūblicae

# Reppetition

# Personal Pronouns
Cicero once again draws attention to his prowess in contrast to Catiline's incompetence by using _ego_. This statement makes Catiline appear severely disadvantaged against Cicero and also gives Cicero more credibility as someone who can discover conspiracies so easily.
> "Haec ego omnia vixdum etiam coetū vestrō dīmissō comperī

      (B)

# Reppetition
Cicero repeats how Catiline had attacked him 3 times and in each repetition describes another way he acted to stop the treachery. This segment serves to further the point that Cicero was wronged and prolong what is essentially a declaration of victory, Cicero also increases the scale of the description of his responses each time, eventually concluding that he saved the entire republic by fighting against Catiline.
> "Catilīna, īnsidiātus es ... tuōs interficere voluistī ... uotiēnscumque mē petīstī
